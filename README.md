# RoseLakeWeather
Rose Lake Weather is an Alexa skill that gets the current weather from a local station (via Wunderground API) and formats it for Alexa.

It is programmed using Python and hosting on the Alexa Developer Console. It has not been published publicly so the only way to use it for yourself is create an Alexa developer account, and then import the skill with their Github import tool.
